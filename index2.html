            I believe it's priced a little bit on the higher side but still it's better than its competitors. 
            Display is less bright than I hoped, with okayish resolution. I have put it on 'Performance boost'
            24/7 mode which reduces battery life but it does feel a bit more snappy and fast. It doesn't feel 
            premium in the hand but it's '4 camera layout' tricks others that it's a Rs12000+ phone; atleast from afar.

        PROS:

             <li>
                Design is best at price of 7k and 4 64 with fingerprint
             </li>
             <li>
                Display is acceptable (it's a long phone)
             </li>

                Battery life is around 9hours but
                You need to disable some important settings of Google and MIUI
             </li>
         </ol>
         <p> You can visit TECHNOBUZZNET channel to disable miui and Google tracker
            It would increase performance and battery backup so much now I get around 12 hours </p>

            This mobile is purely for normal use, I don't recommend this for heavy users. 
            Camera is ok. The battery is really working good and long lasting. Samsung 
            could have given a better processor. I will recommend to choose other mobile in 
            this price range according to processor. Otherwise everything is ok ok.

            Overall very worth for money
            Design is very nice

            This phone review is useful only camera centric customers only.
            onderful Sony sensors .... Samples speaks a lot than my words.
            Software upgradation will boost camera stabilization and performance a lot .
             Am impressed... Low light performance is amazing .
              Awesome Flipkart deals and offers quick delivery. Decent Battery backup for whole day , super fast Charing, No heating issues.
